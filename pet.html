            <p>The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as
                 domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated 
                 carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species
                  of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics 
                  have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the
                   Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet
                    and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding
                    human contact. Valued by humans for companionship and its 
                    ability to kill vermin, the cat's retractable claws are adapted
                    to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong,
                    flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night
                    vision and sense of smell are well developed.
                    It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator.
